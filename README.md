# Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, traffic sign images are classified by means of deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks.
Train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, evaluated the model on unseen test data.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

Installation
---
No specific installation is required. The notebook should run with python 3 with required libraries.
If some of the libraries imported at the beginning has not been installed, please install it - e.g. `pip install xxx`
Then, start the jupyter (`jupyter notebook`) and run all the cells in `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`

Files
---
* Traffic_Sign_Classifier.md - a report of the project findings
* Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb - contains all the code
* data/xxx.p - training data pickled and dumped, which are used as input to the above notebook
* signnames.csv - list of sign names for each of 43 classes
* set_git.sh - setup a git repository
